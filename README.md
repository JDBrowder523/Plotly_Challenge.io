# Belly Button Biodiversity

## Overview

 This project took a JSON file of data collected in patients in regards to the bacteria found in the patient's belly button.  The data was filtered and sorted to be displayed in a webpage that shows the top 10 bacteria found in the patient, the number of times they washed per week, and a bubble chart showing the most prevalent bacteria found.
 The webpage was customized by changing the background color of the header, changing the font color of the webpage title, and adding a brief description under each of the three charts.
